# Role-Based Authentication System
### Description
This project is a full-stack application that implements role-based authentication. It allows users to log in and access different parts of the system based on their assigned roles (e.g., admin, user). Built with a Spring Boot backend and a ReactJS frontend, this system uses MySQL to store user and role data securely.
### Features
- User Registration & Login: Allows new users to register and existing users to log in.
- Role-Based Access: Restricts access to certain features based on user roles.
- JWT Authentication: Secures the backend API with JSON Web Tokens.
- API Endpoints: Provides various endpoints to manage users, roles, and permissions.
- Responsive Frontend: User-friendly interface built with React.
