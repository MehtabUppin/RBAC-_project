# Role-Based Authentication System
### Description
This project is a full-stack application that implements role-based authentication. It allows users to log in and access different parts of the system based on their assigned roles (e.g., admin, user). Built with a Spring Boot backend and a ReactJS frontend, this system uses MySQL to store user and role data securely.
