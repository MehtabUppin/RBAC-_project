# Role-Based Authentication System
## Description
This project is a full-stack application that implements role-based authentication. It allows users to log in and access different parts of the system based on their assigned roles (e.g., admin, user). Built with a Spring Boot backend and a ReactJS frontend, this system uses MySQL to store user and role data securely.
## Features
-  User Registration & Login: Allows new users to register and existing users to log in.
-  Role-Based Access: Restricts access to certain features based on user roles.
-  JWT Authentication: Secures the backend API with JSON Web Tokens.
-  API Endpoints: Provides various endpoints to manage users, roles, and permissions.
-  Responsive Frontend: User-friendly interface built with React.
## Installation
## Prerequisites
- Java(JDK 8 Or hieghr).
- IDE (Optional): Use an IDE like Spring tool suit or Eclipse to simplify development and run your Spring Boot project.
- MySQL.
- Maven: Maven is used to manage dependencies. Download and install it from Maven’s official website.
## Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

Step 1: Create a New Spring Boot Project
Using Spring Initializr:

Go to Spring Initializr.

Set the following project configurations:

Project: Maven Project
Language: Java
Spring Boot: Select the latest stable version
Group: com.example (or your preferred group name)
Artifact: role-based-auth-system
Name: RoleBasedAuthSystem
Package Name: com.example.rolebasedauthsystem
Packaging: Jar
Java Version: 8 or later
In the Dependencies section, add the following:

Spring Web: For building RESTful APIs.
Spring Data JPA: For database interactions using JPA.
MySQL Driver: For connecting to a MySQL database.
Spring Security: For authentication and authorization.
Spring Boot DevTools (optional): For hot reloading in development.
Click Generate to download the project as a .zip file. Extract it, and open the project in your preferred IDE.

Using Your IDE (e.g., STS IDEA):

If you’re using an IDE like STS IDEA, you can create a new Spring Boot project directly within the IDE.
Select File > New > Project, choose Spring Initializr, and follow similar steps as above to add dependencies and configure the project.
Step 3: Configure Database in application.properties
Create a MySQL Database:

Log into your MySQL server:
```
bash
mysql -u root -p
```
Create a new database for the project:
```
sql
CREATE DATABASE role_based_auth_system;
```
Update application.properties with Database Details:

Open the src/main/resources/application.properties file.

Configure your MySQL database connection details as shown below:
```
properties
# Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/role_based_auth_system
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true

```
Replace your_username and your_password with your actual MySQL username and password.

Step 4: Add JWT Secret Key (for Authentication)
In application.properties, add a secret key for JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication:

```
properties
Copy code
jwt.secret=your_jwt_secret_key
 ```
Replace your_jwt_secret_key with a strong, unique secret.

Step 5: Build and Run the Application
To build and run the backend application:

Build the Project:

Open a terminal in the project directory and run:
```
bash
mvn install
```
Run the Application:

Start the Spring Boot application by running:
 ```
bash

mvn spring-boot:run

```
The backend server will start at http://localhost:8080 by default.

Step 6: Verify the Backend Setup
Check API Endpoints: Use a tool like Postman or curl to test API endpoints, such as /login, /register, or any other endpoints defined in your controllers.

Database Verification: Verify that the necessary tables (e.g., for users, roles) have been created in the MySQL database if spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update is set in application.properties.

Access API Documentation (if Swagger is used):

Go to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html to view and test the available API endpoints.
